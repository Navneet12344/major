Masuriya Hill Garden, Jodhpur Overview
Spread across the top of the Masuriya hills is the beautiful Masuriya Hill Garden, a delightful location providing travellers with a 360-degree panoramic view of the city of Jodhpur. Inside, one can find a statue of Veer Durgadas Rathore, a prominent hero amongst the Marwari community. The area is also host to a temple of Baba Ramdev, a local deity. This marvellous vantage point is also home to one of the largest TV towers in India. The famous Mehrangarh fort can be seen at a distance, situated on the opposite side of the city. The garden lies in aesthetically appealing contrast to the rugged rocks located along the road up the hill.

Situated well within the city limits, it is a favourite spot among locals for its panoramic view and amazing sunset experience. The area also houses a restaurant and a playground to keep its guests engaged and refreshed during their visit. The silence can be attractive to those looking for a slice of peace in an otherwise busy city.
