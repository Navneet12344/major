Om Banna Temple, Jodhpur Overview
Om Banna temple, better known as 'Bullet Baba Temple', is a temple with an unusual backstory which may be found on NH65 between Pali and Jodhpur, near the Chotila village. This is the shrine dedicated to Om Banna, a traveller who passed away at his site, and his bike, a 350cc Royal Enfield Bullet. Located 50 km from Jodhpur and 20 km from Pali, this shrine is religiously visited by nearby villagers and devotees to pray for a safe journey and is a hotbed for tourists and travellers due to its origins. This temple is especially popular among Royal Enfield enthusiasts.

Om Banna's bullet is encased in a glass case within the Om Banna temple, which stands at the site of the accident. There is also a bust of Om Banna inside the temple. The tree that Om Banna crashed into still remains at the site, with devotees praying to it along with the statue and the motorcycle to ensure safe travel across the highway. There are hundreds of devotees from nearby villages who come here every day to ensure that they are protected, and it is believed that travellers who do not stop by this temple to pay their respects are doomed to have a perilous journey. Offerings in the form of flowers, prayer strings, and alcohol are presented to the bike.
