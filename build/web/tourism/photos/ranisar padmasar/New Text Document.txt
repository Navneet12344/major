Ranisar Padamsar, Jodhpur Overview
The Ranisar and Padamsar lakes are two adjoining lakes in the city of Jodhpur built over 500 years ago. They are situated at the rear of the Mehrangarh Fort, near the Fateh Pol. These scenic lakes were created to conserve water, as Jodhpur falls under a desert region where water is scarce. The tranquillity of these adjacent lakes is complemented brilliantly by the stark contrast of the majestic Mehrangarh Fort, making it a sight to behold. The clear waters have been preserved and maintained for centuries, providing a serene vibe and an almost identical reflection of the grand fort on its surface.

The development of the two lakes was commissioned by two different queens in the 15th century. Ranisar lake was made on the orders of Queen Jasmade Hadi, wife of Rao Jodha, the founder of Jodhpur. Padamsar lake was created by Queen Padmini, the daughter of Rana Sanga of Mewar. These lakes were built to conserve water in the desert region, serving as excellent examples of the age-old tradition of royal women being in charge of overseeing the public water systems. They represent the classic water storage systems that are ever present throughout this region. They are considered a consistent source of water in the city.
