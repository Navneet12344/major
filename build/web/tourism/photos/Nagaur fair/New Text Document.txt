Nagaur Fair, Jodhpur Overview
Nagaur Fair is the second largest one in all of India. It is conducted in the town named 'Nagaur' and is primarily known as a Cattle Fair. This fair is all about the trading of animals, wherein the animals are presented with colourful accessories upon them. But, this fair is much more than that. It is particularly popular because of its sporty activities like the tug of war, and bullock and camel racing that it showcases. The Nagaur Fair is an eight-day affair, which takes place between the months of January and February.

The main event of the fair is the trade of cattle. Each year, over 0.2 million animals, like oxen, bullocks, camels, goats, horses, cows etc. are brought to the venue by the locals. Nagaur is located between Jodhpur and Bikaner but shepherds and cattlemen from far away also attend the event other than those living nearby, in large numbers to purchase or sell animals. This fair is held over four days and is considered to be the second largest such event in the country. It is organized and managed by the Animal Husbandry Department and the Tourism Department of Rajasthan. So, along with the main event, trading, there are competitions and entertainment that tourists can enjoy too.
