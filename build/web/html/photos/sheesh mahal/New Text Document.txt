Sheesh Mahal, Jodhpur Overview
A characteristic feature of the royal Rajput architecture, the Sheesh Mahal in the Mehrangarh Fort of Jodhpur is a treat to the eye of the beholder. Also known as Glass Palace of Jodhpur, this marvellous piece of architecture is decked from ceiling to floor with intricate mirror work. These decorative ornaments are complemented well with the brightly coloured paintings of various religious figures made in plaster.

The numerous decorative panels show deities like Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva and Parvati, Lord Krishna playing the flute, and Lord Rama among others showing the strong influence of religion and culture on the art of the time. The ceilings and floors are inlaid with mirrors, earning the room the title of Hall of Mirrors. The blue, green, silver, and gold ornaments suspended on the ceiling as well as the grand European chandelier are later additions to this hall. Mehrangarh's Sheesh Mahal was the bedchamber of Maharaja Ajit Singh who reigned over Jodhpur between 1679 and 1724.
