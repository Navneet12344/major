Rao Jodha Desert Rock Park, Jodhpur Overview
Rao Jodha Desert Rock Park was created in 2006 out of a large, rocky wasteland beside the Mehrangarh Fort. The park was built to restore the natural ecology of this neglected terrain and has become a prime tourist attraction of the city today. The rocky ravines are densely populated with the indigenous flora of the Thar desert, there are over 200 species of plants at this ecopark. The region was established as the Rao Jodha Desert Rock Park in 2006 but it was only in 2011 that the public could visit and explore it. It is one of the few places where the real terrain and vegetation of Rajasthan can be witnessed in its natural environment.

The attraction has been one of the famous places for nature lovers and Geologists. Visitors can see the rock formations, the crystal formations, the natural canals, a wide variety of other rocks, plant and animal species which are specific to this region. The Park, partly, was also established for the architectural restoration of the historical monuments in the region. The ecological restoration involved removing the expansive growth of an alien plant called Baavlia and restoring the local, rock-loving, desert vegetation. The park is divided into sections that visitors can explore to learn everything about the Desert Rock Park in Jodhpur.
