Toorji Ka Jhalra, Jodhpur Overview
Constructed in 1740, Toorji Ka Jhalra, commonly called stepwell of Jodhpur, is an intricate design of stepwell, one of the few remaining structures depicting the traditional water management systems of Jodhpur. This architectural wonder was built by the queen-consort of Maharaja Abhaya Singh, a sign of the age-old tradition of the region where royal women were in charge of overseeing the public water works. The design and structure help onlookers comprehend the lifestyle of the earlier generations who had used it in its prime, with the site serving as the local watering hole for its time.

This 250-year-old structure was made using the famous rose-red sandstone found in Jodhpur. More than 200 feet in depth, it was once adorned with intricate carvings of dancing elephants, medieval lions, cow waterspouts, and niches that showed various deities. There were two levels of access and a separate tank which were meant to receive water from the wheel system powered by the bullocks. Its impressive design attracts many tourists, and is regarded as a fun place by locals and visitors to engage in harmless, recreational water games in order to beat the heat.
