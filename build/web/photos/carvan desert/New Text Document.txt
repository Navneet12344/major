Camel Safari, Jodhpur Overview
A trip to the desert would be incomplete without a camel safari across the seemingly endless expanse of the sandy terrain. With Rajasthan being the desert state of India, a trip to this cultural oasis will only feel complete by availing a camel safari. The city of Jodhpur offers multiple packages of varying durations for its visitors. The shortest of these safaris allows one to travel 70 km across the glistening sheets of golden sand of the Thar desert to the ancient town of Osian, steeped in cultural history significant to both Hindus and Jains. If you're feeling especially adventurous, there are packages offering travellers the opportunity to undertake the incredible journey from the blue city of Jodhpur to the golden city of Jaisalmer, spanning roughly 250 km of the mesmerising desert.

Despite the name 'Camel Safari', tour operators go the extra mile to ensure that their guests have the best experience. Depending on the time and budget allocated for this activity, it is usually inclusive of meals, stay (in case of overnight tours), and mingling with the locals through conversation, folk music and folk dance, along with the main attraction of riding the famous ship of the desert. The arduous task of traversing through the desert, faced with the reality of the arid region and the magnificence of the golden dunes and vast stretches will grant travellers the opportunity to live the authentic life of a desert dweller, and it is definitely an experience worth having.
